'''print(foo("Hello!"))
The above function will give you a runtime error, because python can't add 3 to a String (it needs a number)
This error wasn't detected until python started to run the code.'''

print(foo(6))
'''returns 9'''

print("Happy 200h Birthday, George Boole!")

'''None -- serves same purpose as both option none, and unit mkUnit'''
